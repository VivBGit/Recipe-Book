# Recipe-Book

Second attempt at building a basic HTML website in order to re-inforce the lessons learnt in HTML and an opportunity to practice the CSS rules for my next project.

The focus is on using as many CSS rules as possible in order to become familiar with how to write them and the effect they have on the website.
Though CSS is to style the page, this is NOT an exercise in making it look attractive. 

The code is expected to be well formatted, tidy and thorough. Demonstrating comprehensive use of any and all rules learnt at this stage.
